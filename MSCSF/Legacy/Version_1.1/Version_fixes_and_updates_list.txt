	05/04/2020 - Functionality for sub-cellular heterogeneity and reading in maps added; documentation updated; "Sub_cellular_het_geometries" directory and single example map file added to "MSCSF_state_and_geometry_files"; example of using this added to Example_scripts/3D_cell; no 7 
    01/04/2020 - Arguments.c file updated to Windows format as default (works in all OS).


=====Version 1.0 Release.

Version list:
    07/10/2019 - Fix:   In function "output_settings()", the order of variables Gleak and Gup was the incorrect way round relative to the text
    fprintf(so,"\t\t\t\tJup_scale  = %.02f || Jleak_scale = %.02f || || Jrel_scale = %0.2f\n\n", p.Gleak, p.Gup, p.Grel); 
    >>  fprintf(so,"\t\t\t\tJup_scale  = %.02f || Jleak_scale = %.02f || || Jrel_scale = %0.2f\n\n", p.Gup, p.Gleak, p.Grel);

    24/06/2019 - Documentation for installing the package on Windows computers has been included (thank you to Jakub Tomek for this implementation and associated documentation). This is provided ahead of a full version of the framework with included Visual Studio project files, which I intend to finish and upload soon.

    23/06/2019 - Fix:   Small issue with writing the settings file for all implementations other than single native, so it writes now to correct folder.
                        [E.g. output_settings_tissue(Sim, Tissue, directory) -> output_settings_tissue(Sim, Tissue, res_dir_full) in Tissue_native_main.cc and similar equivalents for all main files other than Single_cell_native.cc]

    20/06/2019 - Release version uploaded, with accompanying author revised version of the manuscript (currently under review at PLOS Comp. Biol).
